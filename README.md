# cmd_adventure

CMD Adventure is a command line game that allows the user to pick a class and kill a dragon.

The goal of this project was to explore fundemental OOP concepts and implement them. The code 
is not perfect, refactoring is needed.

Possible commits in the future, but as of right now, this project is considered complete.
